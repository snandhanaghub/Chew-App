## Project Description

Chew™ is a chewing gum timer app that helps you track how long your gum lasts before turning into a flavorless rubbery mess. It gamifies chewing with stats, leaderboards, and chew dates. 

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People forget how long they’ve been chewing gum and start feeling emotionally betrayed when the flavor disappears.  
Also, nobody tracks the chew-to-spit ratio, and that’s a tragedy.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Chew™ lets you:
- Start a gum timer  
- Track your chewing stats  
- Compete with friends on leaderboards  
- Rate gums, complete weekly chew challenges, and even order exclusive gums  

All while doing something completely useless and totally hilarious.
